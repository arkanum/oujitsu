Mock up of updated website for the OUJJC.
Updated text content to reflect some changes, has most of the content from the old site
Some repetitions of info/unnecessary info cut out to streamline it.
More 'modern' UI with a carousel as main focus.
Added banner with all stripped down necessary info (place, time, fb page).
Simple white theme, with red TJF logo. Mostly b&w photos.
(Do we need to put int the OU logo in addition/ place of TJF one)?
Most photos taken from OU sports site which had photos from our club from 2013-2014.
Some pics from TJF fb page, can be changed easily if necessary.
